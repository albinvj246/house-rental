Abstract
The House Renting Management System is a web-based application designed to streamline property rentals by providing an efficient platform for landlords and tenants. Built using Java, Servlets, and JSP, the system enables landlords to list properties, manage tenants, and track rental agreements, while tenants can search for available properties, request rentals, and sign agreements digitally. The platform ensures secure authentication, seamless property management, and an intuitive user experience. By automating the rental process, it reduces paperwork and enhances efficiency for both parties.
